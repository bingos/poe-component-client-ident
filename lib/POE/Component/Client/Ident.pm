=head1 NAME

POE::Component::Client::Ident - A component that provides non-blocking ident lookups to your sessions.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use POE::Component::Client::Ident;

   my $poco_obj = POE::Component::Client::Ident->spawn ( 'Ident-Client' );

   $kernel->post ( 'Ident-Client' => query => Socket => $socket );

   $kernel->post ( 'Ident-Client' => query => PeerAddr => '10.0.0.1', 
				              PeerPort => 2345,
					      SockAddr => '192.168.1.254',
					      SockPort => 6669,
					      BuggyIdentd => 1,
					      TimeOut => 30 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

POE::Component::Client::Ident is a POE component that provides non-blocking Ident lookup services to
other components and sessions. The Ident protocol is described in RFC 1413 L<http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1413.html>.

The component takes requests in the form of events, spawns L<POE::Component::Client::Ident::Agent> sessions to 
perform the Ident queries and returns the appropriate responses to the requesting session.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=over

=item C<spawn>

Takes one argument, a kernel alias to christen the new component with.

Returns an object.

=back

=head1 METHODS

These methods are available on the poco object returned by spawn().

=over

=item C<session_id>

Returns the component's session ID.

=item C<shutdown>

Takes no arguments. Causes the component to terminate gracefully. Any pending Ident::Agent components that are
running will be closed without returning events.

=back

=head1 INPUT

The component accepts the following events:

=over

=item C<query>

Takes either the arguments: 

  "PeerAddr", the remote IP address where a TCP connection has originated; 
  "PeerPort", the port where the TCP has originated from;
  "SockAddr", the address of our end of the connection; 
  "SockPort", the port of our end of the connection;

OR: 

  "Socket", the socket handle of the connection, the component will work out all 
  the details for you. If Socket is defined, it will override the settings of the 
  other arguments.

See the documentation for Ident-Agent for extra parameters you may pass.

=item C<shutdown>

Takes no arguments. Causes the component to terminate gracefully. Any pending Ident::Agent components that are
running will be closed without returning events.

=back

=head1 OUTPUT

The events you can expect to receive having submitted a 'query'.

All the events returned by the component have a hashref as ARG0. This hashref contains the arguments that were passed to
the component. If a socket handle was passed, the hashref will contain the appropriate PeerAddr, PeerPort, SockAddr and Sock
Port.

=over

=item C<ident_client_reply>

Returned when the component receives a USERID response from the identd. ARG0 is hashref, ARG1 is the opsys field and ARG2 is
the userid or something else depending on whether the opsys field is set to 'OTHER' ( Don't blame me, read the RFC ).

=item C<ident_client_error>

Returned when the component receives an ERROR response from the identd, there was some sort of communication error with the
remote host ( ie. no identd running ) or it had some other problem with making the connection to the other host. No matter.
ARG0 is hashref, ARG1 is the type of error.
